Coal mining in India is hazardous due to toxic gas leaks, high temperatures, and poor ventilation, with outdated safety measures leading to delayed responses and fatalities. Limited underground communication further worsens the risks.

We have developed a wearable safety device for coal miners that tracks temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide and methane levels and sends it to the supervisor at the base station on the surface via a relay network. The project uses an ESP32 as its brain, DHT22 for temperature and humidity, MQ-7 for carbon monoxide and MQ-2 gas sensor for methane detection. 

We have also developed a companion web app for the supervisor so that rescue operations and other safety measures can be taken in advance or at least, without delay.
